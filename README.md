# reconjugator

Years ago (around 1974) at the University of Illinois, I worked on the
Modern Hebrew Project to develop computer-assisted instruction materials. One of
the programs I wrote was an “auto-conjugator” that would conjugate verbs
for you.

Over the years I have written it several times, for other languages (see,
for example, https://langintro.com/kintro/grammar/preauto.htm). So, once again,
I am exhuming it for Spanish. Every time I rewrite it, I promise myself this
will be the last time. And, of course, it never is.
